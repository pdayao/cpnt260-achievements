The video interests me because it is simple enough for me to understand with my current level of knowledge and I can see parallels between the code that was used and what we're currently learning about in class. It's also short enough for me to follow along without getting bored or distracted. The video is only a year old so it's still relevant. The author is a frontend developer and javascript enthusiast (according to their blog). Their video also considerably popular with 99k views despite having 6k subscribers.
